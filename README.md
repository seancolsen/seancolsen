## Seeking Web Development Work

_(as of January 2021)_

Having been a tech generalist for over a decade, I'm now looking to bridge the gap between casual freelance work and serious front-end engineering using React or Svelte. My ideal role would be an entry/mid-level position at a small/medium sized company working remotely. I'm ardent about writing clean code, adept at asynchronous communication within distributed teams, and eager to write tests, docs, and code reviews too.
